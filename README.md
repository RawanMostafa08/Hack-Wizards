### Steganography 🔒
Unlock the secrets of steganography, where messages lurk within the pixels of images, waiting to be discovered. Steganography, derived from the Greek words "steganos" (covered) and "graphie" (writing), is the art of concealing messages or information within other non-secret text or data, particularly images.

### Roles 🦊🦅
- **The Fox**: Crafty and cunning, the Fox employs every trick in the book to slip secret messages past the vigilant Eagle. As the Fox, you'll have the opportunity to invest your time wisely into honing your skills and creating distractions to increase your chances of evading the Eagle’s watchful gaze.
- **The Eagle**: With eyes sharp as talons, the Eagle hunts down concealed messages, determined to unravel the Fox's plots. Your mission is to distinguish truth from deception, ensuring that only genuine messages are intercepted while avoiding costly mistakes.

### The Parrot 🦜
Behold the Parrot, the wise overseer of the game, adjudicating the duel of wits between the Fox and the Eagle. The parrot represents the game administrator that receives the messages and scores both ends accordingly.

## Fox: Master of Deception 🦊🎭

### Objective 🎯
As the Fox, your mission is clear: encode secret messages within images using steganography, all while evading the keen eyes of the Eagle. The primary objective for the Fox is to send the secret message to the parrot, encoded through steganography, while devising a strategic game plan to outsmart the Eagle.

### Game Mechanics ⚙️
- Messages are woven into the fabric of images, transmitted through three channels simultaneously. The game is played in chunks (anything between 1 and 20), with each chunk containing 3 channels that concurrently carry your messages.
- Choose wisely between Real, Empty, or elusive Fake messages to confound the Eagle's pursuit. Sending Fake messages is to impede the Eagle’s progress. However, Fake messages are not readily available to you. In order to earn them, you must solve riddles that are provided.
- Solve enigmatic riddles to unlock the power of Fake messages, adding a strategic twist to your cunning plans. To increase your budget of Fake messages, you can choose to solve any of the provided riddles.

### Riddles 🧩
Unravel the mysteries of riddles to earn Fake messages, elevating your devious schemes to new heights. The riddles exist as a side quest for you to solve to gain a budget of Fake messages. You can choose to solve riddles from the available pool in the Riddles Documentation.

## Eagle: Guardian of Truth 🦅🔍

### Objective 🎯
As the Eagle, your duty is clear: intercept Real messages and decipher the hidden truths concealed within. Your efficiency within the designated time frame contributes to the final score.

</div>

### Game Mechanics ⚙️
- Navigate the web of transmission channels, discerning Real messages from Empty and Fake decoys. Analyze footprints to uncover the path to genuine messages, avoiding penalties and pitfalls along the way.
- Only a maximum of one genuine message is sent at any given time. To assist in this identification process, you receive three footprints at a time, with each footprint corresponding to one of the three channels.
